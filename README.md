# Accidental-Drug-Related-Deaths---Visualization
Accidental deaths caused by the over consumption of drugs from the period 2012 to 2018.

I have prepared a total of 7 visualizations and following are the analytical questions and queries a person will be able to answer using the dashboard visualizations:
1.	What is the most consumed drug that is found during the autopsy study?
2.	Which state had the most reported drug related cases?
3.	How is the drug consumption behavior every year? Is it increasing or decreasing?
4.	Among the given races, which population cases were reported more?
5.	Where were the victims during the time of death?
6.	Visualize the age distribution for the reported cases.
7.	Visualize the yearly distribution of the reported cases.
